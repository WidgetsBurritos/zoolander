  .col-md-8
    p Our icons help us to express the attributes of our brand, products, services, workloads, technology and ideas in ways that are immediately recognizable.
    p We use icons as a graphical representation of a product, service, workload, technology or idea. They should not stand alone. Instead, they should be accompanied by a headline or body copy, and the corporate logo should appear somewhere on the same page or asset.
    For icon font downloads, examples, usage and ideograms please refer to the documentation on

  .col-md-8
    p The CTA language's role is to help visitors make up their mind about why they should click on the button. It should also give the user an idea on what’s going to happen next.
    p It’s not just the copy on the button either. It’s how the copy on the button goes together on what else is going on on the page. Is this relevant? Generally, generic words like Download, Submit and the like are less likely to generate any meaningful lift, because they lack character &amp; don’t provide any value or relevance.
