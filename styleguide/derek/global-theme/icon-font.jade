    p Our icons help us to express the attributes of our brand, products, services, workloads, technology and  ideas  in ways that are immediately recognizable.
    p We use icons as a graphical representation of a product, service, workload, technology or  idea. They should not stand alone. instead, they should be accompanied by a headline or body copy, and the corporate logo should appear somewhere on the same page or asset.

    ul
      li icons are one color and used  in dark, medium and light gray.
      li An icon should be used  in the context of an  idea, service offering, solution area or workload where possible (paired with solution area/workload names, part of an  ideogram, diagram or  illustration).
      li Make sure that all icons used together have the same line weight.

    h5.red Usage:
    p  in order to use the Rackspace web font  in your markup you will need to put in <code>&#60;span class="rsweb name-of-icon">&#60;/span&#62;</code> replacing "name-of-icon" with the name that appears underneath the  icon you've chosen.
    p To change the font color to white add the class "white" to your  icon class.
